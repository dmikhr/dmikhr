Hi üëã, my name is Dmitrii. I specialize in backend web development, CLI tools, and R&D software. My primary programming language is **Go**, but I also work with Python and Ruby. I value code quality through the use of linters, tests, and documentation. Beyond coding, I manage the entire software engineering lifecycle‚Äîfrom translating stakeholder requirements into technical specifications to architecting solutions and collaborating effectively with my team.

**Some of my open source projects on GitHub:**
- [PDFJuicer](https://github.com/dmikhr/pdfjuicer) (Golang) - tool for extracting pages from PDF as images with custom sizing, scaling and thumbnail generation.
- [MOOC DSL](https://github.com/dmikhr/mooc-dsl) (Golang) - Domain-Specific Language for EdTech. Simplifies how educators create and distribute online tests.
- [tiempo-tracker](https://github.com/dmikhr/tiempo-tracker) (Python) - CLI time tracker. Especially convenient for users who work with window managers or multiple terminal panes. üìù Article about the app: [Building CLI time tracker with Python](https://dev.to/dmikhr/building-cli-time-tracker-with-python-o0g)
- [DudeGL](https://github.com/dmikhr/DudeGL) (Ruby) - a tool for visual code analysis and teaching OOP concepts ([see example](https://github.com/dmikhr/DudeGL/wiki/Git-diff-visualization)). Featured on a software engineering podcast [Ruby Rogues #668](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/rules-of-oop-in-pictures-with-ivan-nemytchenko-ruby-668/id1237406856?i=1000683474802).

Hi üëã, my name is Dmitrii. I specialize in backend web development, CLI tools, and R&D software. My primary programming language is **Go**, but I also work with Python and Ruby. I value code quality through the use of linters, tests, and thorough documentation. Beyond coding, I manage the entire software engineering lifecycle‚Äîfrom translating stakeholder requirements into technical specifications to architecting solutions and collaborating effectively with my team.

**Some of my open source projects on GitHub:**
